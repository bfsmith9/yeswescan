## Purpose

- Beth only wants the barcode and the quantity (the number right after the first long barcode). 
- The quantity will only be 1-3 characters. No thousands or more
- After the output of one without any number, put a "1" for the quantity. 

Plan: import input file, grab barcode & quantity, output that to an output file.


## Sample input file:
